<!-- An icon aka glyphicon, iconography, is a simple picture that can be used as a button, hyperlink, bullet points or pretty much anything you can think of. There are lots of options and icon providers out there so you need to do a little research to find exactly what you are looking for. Once you find what you like, the process is pretty much the same across providers.  We are going to be using Font awesome to demonstrate finding and placing icons on a webpage -->
